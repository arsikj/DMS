	<h1>Help</h1>
	<p align="justify">Thank you for using our application. DMS is intended to help diabetics to manage better their diabetes and keep it under control. 
	Although diabetes is not curable, it is a treatable disease and individuals who take a proactive role in their own treatment achieve
	 the best long-term results. One of the critical functions of a proper diabetes management plan is monitoring blood sugar levels.
	  Exercise is also a key component to managing diabetes. In this application, you can input your daily blood glucose and 
	  exercise information.
