	Although diabetes is not curable, it is a treatable disease and individuals who take a proactive role in their own treatment achieve
	 the best long-term results. One of the critical functions of a proper diabetes management plan is monitoring blood sugar levels.
	  Exercise is also a key component to managing diabetes. In this application, you can input your daily blood glucose and
